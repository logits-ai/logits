# NeuroSpeak: The Neuro-Inclusive Workspace

## Overview

**NeuroSpeak** is a specialized productivity workspace designed to adapt to the unique needs of neurodivergent minds. Built for individuals with ADHD, Autism, Dyslexia, and executive function challenges, it aims to lower the barrier to starting tasks by reducing digital noise and friction.

Unlike traditional to-do apps that can be overwhelming with complex menus and rigid structures, NeuroSpeak offers a fluid, sensory-friendly environment. It prioritizes "starting" over "organizing," helping users break through executive dysfunction and blank-page paralysis.

## Key Features

### 🧠 Neuro-Inclusive Input ("Walkie-Talkie" Mode)
* **Frictionless Capture:** A large, distraction-free text area encourages brain-dumping without judgment.
* **Hold-to-Speak:** Instead of hunting for buttons, simply hold the **Spacebar for 1 second** to activate voice-to-text. Release to stop. This mimics a natural thought process, bypassing the mental block of typing.

### 🎨 Sensory Regulation & Accessibility
* **Visual Customization:**
    * **High Contrast Mode:** Deep blacks and striking yellows for users with light sensitivity or visual processing needs.
    * **Soft Mode (Dyslexia Friendly):** Uses the OpenDyslexic font and warm background tones to improve readability and reduce visual stress.
* **Panic Mode:** A dedicated safety button that instantly simplifies the interface, removing all non-essential elements to help users regain control during moments of sensory overwhelm.

### ⚡ Gamified Energy Management
* **Energy Crystals:** Instead of just tracking time, users can track their mental "Bandwidth." Visual crystal indicators help users become more aware of their current energy levels, promoting sustainable work habits.
* **Reward System:** Users earn coins and positive reinforcement for initiating and completing tasks, providing a dopamine loop that encourages consistency.

### 🔋 The Dopamine Menu (Recharge Station)
* **Intentional Interaction:** Accessed via a satisfying "Fingerprint Sync" hold interaction, preventing accidental clicks and building a ritual around self-care.
* **Curated Regulation Tools:** A built-in menu offering immediate tools to regulate the nervous system:
    * **Zen Mode:** Guided box breathing exercises.
    * **Hydration Log:** Simple water tracking.
    * **Focus Music:** Direct links to curated playlists.
    * **Visual Stims:** Access to satisfying visual loops for sensory grounding.
